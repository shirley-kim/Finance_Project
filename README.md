# Finance_Project

This python project analyzes stock data of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo from January 3, 2006 to March 27, 2018. I used <a href='https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-stock-data'>Quandlâ€™s API for Stock Data</a> in this project.
